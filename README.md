# World42

World42 is a high-performance, multithreaded planet rendering engine that leverages a quadtree structure to dynamically manage Levels of Detail (LOD) for planetary surfaces. The project uses Web Workers for heavy geometry calculations and a floating-origin system to maintain precision even at vast distances. World42 is designed to render detailed, textured planetary surfaces with efficient LOD management. It uses a custom quadtree structure to subdivide the planet's surface and dynamically update patches based on the camera's distance and movement. By offloading geometry calculations to Web Workers, the engine maintains a smooth, responsive user experience.

## Features
